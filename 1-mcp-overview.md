# MCP: Model Context Protocol and Open-Source Implementations

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard by Anthropic for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI applications" – it provides a universal interface so that large language models (LLMs) can access a variety of systems in a secure, standardized way.

MCP follows a simple client-server architecture:
- An **LLM host** (the AI app or agent) runs an MCP **client** to connect with one or more MCP **servers**
- Each server exposes a particular tool or data source
- This decouples tool implementation from the AI agent, making integrations easier to scale and reuse

## MCP Reference Servers

Anthropic open-sourced a collection of MCP server implementations in various languages. The GitHub repository **`modelcontextprotocol/servers`** contains many example servers for common tools.

Examples include MCP servers for:
- Web fetching
- Filesystem access  
- GitHub/Git integration
- Google Drive
- Databases
- And more

Each server is a lightweight program (often in TypeScript or Python) that provides a specific capability to an LLM via the MCP protocol. These reference servers demonstrate how MCP can **securely give LLMs controlled access** to resources like files and APIs.

Developers can use them out-of-the-box or build custom servers using the official MCP SDKs (available in Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C#, etc.).

## Notable MCP Implementations

### `lastmile-ai/mcp-agent`

This is an open-source framework that combines MCP with agent patterns. The **mcp-agent** library in Python helps build "agentic" AI applications by:
- Managing MCP connections
- Implementing proven agent design patterns

It was inspired by Anthropic's *"Building Effective Agents"* paper and the MCP launch. In practice, `mcp-agent` handles:
- The lifecycle of connecting to MCP servers (so developers don't have to manage JSON-RPC connections manually)
- Abstractions for common agent workflows (sequence of reasoning steps, tool use, error handling)
- A model-agnostic implementation of OpenAI's **Swarm** pattern for multi-agent orchestration

Overall, `mcp-agent` makes it simpler to wire up a robust AI agent that can call MCP-exposed tools and follow best practices for planning and tool use.

### Other MCP Integrations

Beyond the reference servers and `mcp-agent`, the community has built connectors to use MCP with other AI platforms:
- LastMile AI released an **OpenAI Agents SDK – MCP extension** that bridges OpenAI's agent API with MCP
- This allows tools from MCP servers to be utilized as if they were native OpenAI functions in an "OpenAI Agent" setting
- In Microsoft's Azure AI ecosystem, MCP has been introduced to unify how their AI "agents" access enterprise data

These efforts show that MCP is gaining adoption as a *standard protocol* to plug in external capabilities to various agent frameworks.
