# System Architecture Design and Scalability Analysis

## System Architecture Design (LLM, Agent, MCP, Vector DB Integration)

Bringing it all together, we propose an **integrated high-performance AI agent architecture** that leverages the strengths of LLMs, agentic frameworks, MCP, and an Elixir distributed platform.

### Key Components

#### LLM (Large Language Model)
- Core reasoning engine of the agent
- Could be an external API (like OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude) or a self-hosted model
- Used by the agent to interpret tasks, reason in natural language, and decide on actions
- Not directly exposed to all tools for security; it only interacts via the agent
- The agent sends prompts/questions to the LLM and receives back either answers or function-call requests

#### Agent Host (Agentic AI Framework & MCP Clients)
- The "brains" of the system that orchestrates everything
- Includes the agentic framework logic (planning, dividing tasks, handling multi-step workflows)
- Runs the MCP client interfaces
- Could be implemented in Elixir for high concurrency, or Python or a mix
- Responsible for:
  - Managing the **conversation with the LLM** (maintaining prompt context, sending user queries and prior tool results)
  - Running the **Agent logic** (decides when to query the LLM, when to call a tool, or when to finish)
  - Maintaining connections to various **MCP Servers**
  - Interfacing with the **Vector Database** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or long-term memory

#### Vector Database
- Specialized data store (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS)
- Used to store embeddings of knowledge and enable semantic search
- The agent can query the vector DB to retrieve relevant context (documents, facts) related to the user's query
- Can be populated with company documents or past conversation summaries
- Gives the LLM a memory beyond its fixed context window
- The Agent Host might call the vector DB directly via a library, or treat the vector search as another "tool"

#### MCP Servers (Tool Services)
- External tool integrations running as separate services
- Each MCP server is focused on one domain:
  - **Fetch Server**: Retrieves web content given a URL
  - **Filesystem Server**: Allows the agent to read or write local files in a controlled directory
  - **DB Query Server**: Connects to a database or performs SQL queries
  - Many other servers are possible: APIs (Slack, GitHub, etc.), computational tools, image generation, etc.
- The Agent Host communicates with MCP servers via **JSON-RPC calls**
- Servers interact with **External services/data**
- This separation means the LLM itself never directly accesses these resources; it must go through the MCP server
- MCP servers can enforce **access controls and sanitize inputs** (ensuring safe tool usage)

### Data Flow

A typical request in this system works as follows:

1. **User Query -> LLM**: The user question or task comes into the Agent Host. The Agent Host may prepend system prompt or context (including any retrieved docs from the vector DB) and then sends the prompt to the LLM for processing.

2. **LLM Reasoning -> Tool Use**: The LLM processes the query. If it can answer directly, it will just return an answer. If it determines it needs external info or actions, it will output a response indicating a tool to use. The Agent Host sees this and pauses the LLM.

3. **Agent Host MCP Call**: Based on the requested tool, the host dispatches an MCP JSON-RPC request to the appropriate server. For example, `tools/call` to Fetch with params `{"url": "..."}`. The server executes the action and returns the result.

4. **Tool Result -> LLM**: The Agent Host takes the result from the MCP server and feeds it back into the LLM's context. The LLM resumes its reasoning with this new information.

5. Steps 2-4 may repeat in a loop â€“ the LLM can chain multiple tool calls. The agent framework can enforce limits or add additional prompts.

6. **Final Answer**: Eventually the LLM produces a final answer. The Agent Host returns this to the user, and also may log the interaction, store embeddings of the Q&A into the vector DB, etc.

### Orchestration and Concurrency

- This architecture can support **multi-agent setups**
- The Agent Host could spawn multiple LLM agents working in parallel on sub-tasks
- For example, one agent could be fetching data while another is summarizing something else
- Elixir's platform is capable of handling these concurrent processes easily
- MCP servers can be reused by multiple agents if designed to (though one might also run separate server instances per agent to avoid state collision)

### Deployment Considerations

- Each MCP server can be containerized (Docker is suggested for MCP servers to avoid environment conflicts)
- In production, you might run:
  - MCP servers as microservices (Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes)
  - Agent Host as a scalable web service that spawns agent processes per request or session
  - Vector DB as a managed cloud service or a distributed system like Elasticsearch with an ANN plugin
  - LLM via API or as your own model server (on GPUs)
- There is flexibility in substituting components as long as the interfaces remain consistent

## Scalability and Bottleneck Analysis

Designing for high performance means anticipating how the system scales with load and where bottlenecks might occur:

### Throughput and Concurrency

- Elixir-based host can handle many operations concurrently
- Each user query or agent can run as an isolated process
- Multiple tool calls can overlap in time if the logic allows
- Elixir can manage thousands of processes, serving many user sessions in parallel
- **LLM API** calls are typically the slowest step (hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds)
- Overlapping I/O (tool calls) with LLM thinking time is beneficial for throughput

### LLM Bottleneck

- The LLM itself is often the rate-limiting factor (API rate limits, context length limits)
- To scale throughput:
  - Use a pool of API keys or models
  - Fine-tune a smaller model to handle more requests in-house
  - Run multiple instances of the Agent Host connected to the LLM service
- A **shared vector DB** can help ensure consistent memory across replicas
- Caching frequently used results can alleviate load on both LLM and tool calls

### MCP Tool Scalability

Each MCP server is essentially a microservice:
- Some are stateless (e.g., a fetch server just does HTTP calls)
- Others might have state (like a memory server maintaining a knowledge graph)

For scalability:
- Deploy **multiple instances of each MCP server** and have the Agent Host choose one
- For heavy tools like a database query, optimize the DB (indexes, etc.) or use read replicas
- Handle rate limits for tools involving external APIs
- Design with back-pressure for optimal performance

### Agent Orchestration Overhead

- The agent framework logic is usually not a big performance hit
- However, if the framework uses many intermediate LLM calls, those add to latency
- "Reflection" steps can double the number of LLM calls
- There's a trade-off between agent sophistication and latency
- Monitor how many LLM calls an agent workflow is making and optimize prompts

### Latency of MCP Calls

- Calling a tool via MCP adds some latency overhead (serialization, IPC, etc.)
- For local tools using stdio, this overhead is on the order of milliseconds
- For remote tools over SSE/HTTP, it could be tens of milliseconds
- Generally, this is small compared to the actual work the tool does
- Running the MCP client in a separate Elixir process (which is the norm) avoids blocking issues
- **Streaming** can be used to optimize latency for large results

### Potential Bottlenecks & Solutions

#### Single-threaded servers
- Many reference MCP servers (Python/Node) might handle one request at a time
- If an agent tries to call the same server again before the first call finishes, it might queue or cause contention
- **Solution**: Run multiple server instances or ensure the server code is async

#### Memory and context
- LLMs have context length limits (e.g., 4k or 8k tokens)
- Naively dumping every retrieved document into the prompt will hit a limit and slow down
- Implement summarization and offload long-term info to the vector DB

#### Network and I/O
- Network latency between components can add up
- Collocating services reduces latency but might limit scaling
- Monitor potential bottlenecks like slow disk or saturated network
- Use caching at multiple levels to avoid repetitive work

#### Agent host performance
- If implementing the host in Elixir, sending data between Elixir and Python can be a bottleneck if done excessively
- Axon's approach of embedding a FastAPI might mitigate overhead by using HTTP for bigger payloads
- Design with back-pressure: if the LLM is still generating output, perhaps hold off on sending new tool requests

### Scaling Out

As demand grows, each part of the system can be scaled out horizontally:
- Run multiple agent host instances (behind a load balancer for user requests)
- Use a cluster of vector DB shards for large datasets
- Increase MCP server replicas for popular tools
- Ensure the LLM calls are distributed (multiple API keys or fine-tuned smaller models)
- Use OTP's distribution if using Elixir to have multiple nodes share workload

The design should also identify **failure points**: if a tool is down or unresponsive, the agent should handle that gracefully. Supervisors in Elixir can auto-restart a crashed tool server. Timeouts should be set for tool calls so an LLM isn't waiting forever.

## Summary

The combination of an **agentic framework** with **MCP** and a **distributed architecture** allows a powerful AI system that is both extensible and scalable. By using MCP, we get a uniform way to add new capabilities to our AI. By leveraging frameworks like LangGraph or AutoGen, we simplify the complexity of the agent's decision-making logic. Using Elixir and a microservice approach provides the industrial-grade reliability and concurrency to serve many requests and complex workflows.

We must remain mindful of bottlenecks â€“ primarily the LLM and external calls â€“ and use strategies like caching, parallelism, and prudent tool use to mitigate them. With these considerations, our system can handle increasing load and problem complexity, providing robust AI-driven assistance in a modular, maintainable way.
